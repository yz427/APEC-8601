Policy summary for the South Korean government: As policymakers committed to green economic growth, understanding the complex effects of land use policies and environmental shifts on ecosystem services is crucial, as evidenced by studies on carbon storage, water yield, crop pollination, sediment, and nitrogen export under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. The results indicate a progressive decrease in carbon storage alongside rising sediment and nitrogen exports, suggesting possible environmental degradation. The enforcement of a no agricultural land change policy has had varied effects, with slight improvements in pollination and nitrogen exports but a worsening in carbon storage and increased sediment export. These dynamics highlight the importance of designing policies that acknowledge regional disparities and the interdependence of ecosystem services to promote sustainable development. Effective management approaches should strive to optimize land use to bolster biodiversity, improve water and soil quality, and maximize ecosystem service benefits, thus supporting a resilient green economy in Korea.
